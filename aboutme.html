            <h3>Shaktimaan</h3>
            <p>Shaktimaan attained his heroic powers through deep meditation and was capable of activating certain chakras which gave him powers. Shaktiman’s alter ego, a photographer for the newspaper Aaj Ki Aawaz, named Pandit Gangadhar Vidyadhar Mayadhar Omkarnath Shastri falls in love with Geeta Vishwas, a reporter for the same newspaper. Shaktimaan arch rival is ‘Tamraj Kilvish’ and who could forget his famous line “Aandhera Kaayam Raahe!” (Let the darkness prevail!).</p>
